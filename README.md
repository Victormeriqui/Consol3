# Consol3
A graphics engine that executes entirely on the CPU

Requirements:
  - No external libraries other than the ones Windows provides
  - No "C with classes"
  - Use of modernish c++
  - Conhost must be left in the same state as it started, even with errors the engine must exit gracefully
  - Everything weird/undocumented is fair game
  - No hard attachment/dependencies, things need to be open for extension closed for modification
